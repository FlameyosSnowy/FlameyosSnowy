## Libraries
- **WIP** MCMAPI: A high-performance library to significantly reduce the development time of creating feature-rich minigames; such as skywars, bedwars, and MCMAPI is very portable allowing you to create MULTIPLE minigames in just one implementation of MCMAPI.
- Havic: an OOP-based (not annotation based) command library for spigot made to be balanced between runtime performance and development time, nearly the performance of bukkit's command API but still a lot less boilerplate.
- Woody: a High-performance and feature-rich menus library originally based on triumph-gui as a more modern alternative (not drop-in replacement)
